# Roadmap Chat Client 0.1.0b (beta)
### DISCLAIMER
THIS PROJECT COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
THERE ARE BUGS, THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL VERY EXPERIMENTAL.
## Info
Thank you for checking out this project! My goal is to experiment with a client/server Restful API Model in the form of a chat application.

We have just entered beta!

The production server is not ready at this moment. If you experience any connectivity issues, this is likely because of that very reason. I will be releasing the beta server very soon. Thank you for your patience.

## Version 0.1.0b

This is the first release of the chat client! The code is still very messy, I will clean it up in the morning. I've fixed all the small bugs I could before pushing this inital release out.

Known bugs: "Pressing the Enter key does not send messages.", "The server crashes occasionally.", "The send button does not load correctly on mobile devices (I will improve the UI in 0.1.0b)".

Please contact me at kaz@rdmap.dev if you come across any issues while using the software.

## API Resources:
/chat, /chat/log, /chat/log/numberof, /chat/submit

(/chat currently does not return anything useful)

##### And now I must go to bed because I have been working on this for 10 hours straight or something.
